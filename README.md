# rust-guessing_game

This repository contains the implementation of a guessing game built using the Rust language.

How it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.
